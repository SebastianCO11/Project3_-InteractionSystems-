# Limbo - Procedural Music Generation

## Project Members

## Project Description

This project creates procedural music for the horror game **Limbo** using OpenMusic (OM). The music is generated algorithmically in real-time, with no pre-recorded audio files. The composition focuses on creating a dark, suspenseful atmosphere that matches the psychological horror theme of the game.

## About the Game

Limbo is a puzzle-platformer game with a dark, atmospheric style. Players control a young boy searching for his sister in a dangerous black-and-white world. The game is known for its minimalist design, silent storytelling, and oppressive atmosphere filled with deadly traps and mysterious creatures. Our music aims to enhance this experience through haunting piano melodies.

## Tools Used

- **OpenMusic (OM)**: Visual programming environment for algorithmic music composition
- **Piano**: Solo instrument chosen for the composition
- **MIDI**: For audio output and recording

## Musical Approach

The generated music creates a dark and suspenseful atmosphere using only piano sounds. The composition uses:

- **Low register notes**: To create a heavy, ominous feeling
- **Dissonant intervals**: To generate tension and unease
- **Slow tempo**: To build suspense
- **Random variations**: To keep the music unpredictable and fresh
- **Minor scales**: To maintain a dark, somber mood

## Requirements Met

- ✅ Minimum 2 minutes duration
- ✅ At least 1 minute of non-repeating music
- ✅ No pre-recorded audio files used
- ✅ Consistent with Limbo's atmosphere
